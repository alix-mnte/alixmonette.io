        <h3>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>My name is Alix Monette, I am 21 years old, and soon will be 22 years old. I was born on the 25th March 2002 in Avignon, France.</p>
            <p>I am franco-canadian because of my parents nationalities, and that's a plus since I love Canada and France.</p>
            <p>I consider myself as a nice person, who loves organization, I am always on time, or even early.</p>

            <p>My mother is French, and my dad Canadian. So me and my two younger sisters got both of their nationalities.
            </p>
            <p>We are a family of 5, but we decided to grow it by adopting four animals as well.
                We have two dogs and two cats.
